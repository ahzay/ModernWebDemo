# Simple Form With Backend

This is a simple web application that demonstrates basic interactions between a front-end HTML form and a back-end server using vanilla JavaScript with no packages. The application allows users to submit a form, and the submitted data is displayed on the server. The code is thoroughly commented for js beginners.
